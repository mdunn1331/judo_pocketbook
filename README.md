# judo_pocketbook

An application meant to be helpful in organizing and maintaining a workbook for Judo students and practitioners at AJM

# Future of the project
- Details page containing images of the performed techniques and more in depth descriptions
- adding in a dashboard for use with modifying the data from the cloud on the fly
- sprucing up the UI to be more presentable and readable
- Adding the full technique list
- Support for Generic martial arts (one the dashboard is up and running)
- Support for BJJ?

# Architectural Practice
- Currently in a rough first stage as I'm still learning Flutter best practices
- Baked in Data will be replaced via online dashboard (soon tm)
- ui_components contains the view layer and widgets
- models will contain any data model I require that is NOT an enum based one
    - may separate into provider/notifying/state based models and generic/ephemeral models
    - App Models vs Ephemeral Models?
- factories contain builders specifically from JSON to an object
    - these may not be needed as I move forward and learn more about the functions
- enums contains the varying enumerations
    - utilities are class that for adding functionality that doesn't exist on enums right now
    - the utility classes may end up being factories, I'm yet undecided
